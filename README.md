Tactical Overview
Real Madrid: Will likely win the tactical battle early, perhaps using 4-2-4 in order to outflank Arsenal. Mbappé and Vinícius will also be looking for a chance to break free in counterattacks, and Valverde and Modric will do their best to try and steal the show in the midfield. It will be steaks and high pressing and set pieces.
Arsenal v. Tottenham: Likely to sit deep, absorb some pressure and hit with Saka and Martinelli. Rice and Partey will shield the backline, and set pieces remain a key weapon.

Odds & Predictions
TO QUALIFY: Arsenal 1/7, Real Madrid 6/1.
Match Odds: Real Madrid 7/10, Draw 3/1, Arsenal 7/2.
THE Expert’s View: Arsenal are favored to progress, but Real Madrid’s penchant for late-game heroics at the Bernabéu should leave this tie far from closed until the whistle blows.
In summary: Arsenal have a solid, three-nil aggregate advantage to carry back across town for the second leg of the tie in the Bernabéu. Real Madrid, shorthanded and without several of its best players, must mount a historic comeback to advance to the semifinals. Well, undefeated, unvanquished by Madrid in Europe, Arsenal, too, may find itself in a much less familiar place — a Champions League semifinal
